Introduction about data store


What does Datastore mean?
A datastore is a repository for storing, managing and distributing data sets on an enterprise level. It is a broad term that incorporates all types of data that is produced, stored and used by an organization. The term references data that is at rest and used by one or more data-driven applications, services or individuals.
A datastore may include data from end user database applications, files or documents, or the random data property of an organization or an information system. Datastore data may be structured, unstructured or in another electronic format.
Depending on the organization, a datastore may be classified as an application-specific datastore, operational datastore or centralized datastore. Moreover, a datastore may be designed and implemented by using purpose-built software or through typical database applications
